# Institute Management System

This project is a backend service for an Institute Management System, providing a RESTful API built with Java and Spring Boot. It allows for the management of institutes, including registration, modification, and retrieval of institute information. Additionally, Docker support is provided for easy deployment.

## Features

- Institute Registration: Endpoint for registering new institutes with fields for name, location, contact information, and additional details.
- Institute Modification: Endpoint for modifying institute information based on the institute's ID.
- Institute Information Retrieval: Endpoint to retrieve information about a specific institute based on its ID.
- Proper input validation and handling of edge cases.
- Secure storage of institute data.

## Project Structure

The project structure follows a typical Spring Boot application layout:

- `src/main/java`: Contains Java source files.
  - `com.example.ims.controller`: Controllers for handling HTTP requests.
  - `com.example.ims.entity`: Entity classes representing data models.
  - `com.example.ims.exception`: Custom exception classes.
  - `com.example.ims.repository`: Data access layer with repository interfaces.
  - `com.example.ims.service`: Service layer containing business logic.
- `src/main/resources`: Contains application properties and other resources.
- `Dockerfile`: Defines the Docker configuration for the application.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository
2. Build the project
3. Run Docker container


   
## Usage

Once the application is running, you can access the API endpoints using tools like cURL, Postman, or your browser:

- Registration: `POST http://localhost:8080/institutes`
- Modification: `PUT http://localhost:8080/institutes/{id}`
- Retrieval: `GET http://localhost:8080/institutes/{id}`

Replace `{id}` with the ID of the institute you want to modify or retrieve.
